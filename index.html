			<h1 id="initial-header">The Mechanism of How Void Maps Drop</h1>
					<p>Void Maps are a unique type of map which can only show up after you have used the portal device, and which reward a juicy amount of helium (or at least, a juicy amount <em>for the zone you clear it on</em>). Elusive and unpredictable, they appear to show up whenever they wish. Through a little bit of magic and a whole lot of looking at code, however, all of their secrets have been revealed.</p>
					<p>Void Maps are dropped by a combined random-chance <em>and</em> a constrained time delay system. You cannot get a new void map immediately after getting the last one, but you also cannot predict exactly when the next one will drop.</p>
					<p>These systems are switched between perfectly continuously. If you pass beyond the time delay period and then switch away from your void map drop chance heirloom, you are seamlessly back in the (now longer) time delay period. Or, if you are slogging along through the natural time delay period and then switch to an heirloom with high void map drop chance, you can suddenly have significant chances to acquire a void map on each world cell you clear.</p>
				<h3 id="time-delay-portion">The time delay portion of the drop mechanism</h3>
					<p>The time delay period is an enforced wait of a certain number of world cells that you need to clear before the void maps can possibly drop. It mostly depends on your highest zone ever (your &quot;HZE&quot;), though if you portal only a small distance (25 zones or less) before your HZE then it will use that last portal zone instead.</p>
					<p>Whichever number it uses, it then clamps to a minimum of 80 and a maximum of 200 (inclusive). For HZE 80 and below, the time delay is <strong>1000</strong> cells. Above that, it delays by an additional 13 cells per zone, up to a maximum of <strong>2560</strong> cells at HZE 200 and above.</p>
					<p>The time delay is modified, however, by the Void Map Drop Chance on Shield heirlooms and by the effect of the Golden Void upgrades, whether you have one or both. The time delay is <em>decreased</em> by those percentages, so if you had a time delay of 1000 cells, and a 25% VMDC mod on your shield, then your time delay would act as if it were 750 cells. Or, if you had a time delay of 2000 (as if you had portalled on zone 157...almost), and a shield with 50% VMDC and 50% VMDC from golden voids, then you would have a practical time delay of only 500 cells, as both 50% modifiers independently halve the delay.</p>
					<p>Golden Voids&#39; VMDC bonus cannot exceed 72%, while shield heirlooms have a varying cap on VMDC based on the rarity of the shield.</p>
				<h3 id="random-chance-portion">The random chance portion of the drop mechanism</h3>
					<p>Past the time delay portion, every ten world cells cleared contributes an additive 0.002% chance for a void map to drop from each world cell. After 8 zones (which is 800 cells), the chance would thus be at .16% per cell.</p>
					<p>This is a very unreliable randomness - so many random chances, but at such initially small odds, means that it takes <em>quite a while</em> for the void map to have a reasonable chance to drop, but it also means that despite it being theoretically possible for a void map to fail to drop for 500 zones of this random rolling phase, it would be astronomically unlikely for a void map to drop later than 38 zones into the phase.</p>
					<p>Also throwing an additional bit of confusion into the mix: the random function used by Trimps is... a choice. It is surprisingly periodic, definitely not quite uniform, and just generally a bad choice for being a <em>good</em> random function. That said, it is not actually unrandom - it is unpredictable, and gives a good curve of results when graphed over the full possible range.</p>
					<p>For hard numbers, this random chance portion is on average <strong>859.33</strong> cells long, with a standard deviation of 473.45 cells. The median duration is 801 cells, while 40% drop before 683 cells and 40% drop after 925 cells, and 1% drop before 90 cells and 1% drop after 2219 cells. The maximum wait time is 3087 cells, and the minimum is 11.</p>
					<p>These numbers are sourced from a complete survey of the possible seeds one can start this portion with, with a small portion of seeds surveyed which should be impossible but which are nonetheless technically within reach. To explain: upon portalling, a random number between 0 and 999999 (inclusive) is generated, and is used as the seed for the random function exclusively for the Void Map dropping chances. This seed then only increases, by one or two per world cell cleared, until the next portal. Due to the nature of the game, this seed cannot ever exceed 1161999. This limit is even, almost certainly, an overestimate of the highest seed ever reached - but it is a guaranteed line that the game cannot cross, at least in version 5.9.2 (previous or future versions may differ, and I will probably still be observing the limit to see if it ever climbs above what I have explored here).</p>
				<h3 id="strategies-and-implications">Some comments on strategies and implications</h3>
					<p>The way that the time delay gets longer as one pushes past zone 80 (until one begins pushing past zone 200) might seem to imply that pushing to new highest zones is actually a net loss. However, the challenges, bonuses, and features those zones unlock are some incredibly powerful benefits, and the delay per zone is not even that significant: at its greatest effect, with the switch from portal-zone 80 to portal-zone 81, it will delay each void map by about <em>0.7%</em>, and each zone&#39;s effect tapers down to a mere <em>0.3%</em> at the portal-zone 199 to portal-zone 200 switch. Do not fear pushing.</p>
					<p>Golden Voids are a significant boost to how many voids one can expect to get. However, when one&#39;s Achievement bonus is small, the time it takes to acquire all 8 Golden Voids weakens them dramatically, especially since the first 5 Golden Voids are not even giving half of the total boost yet. The rule of thumb is to not bother with Golden Voids until you have 2500% achievement percentage and are reaching zone 350 regularly - before then, the extra helium income from additional Golden Heliums will outweigh the extra helium from the additional void maps you (might) get.</p>
					<p>With higher tiers of shield heirlooms, the cap on their Void Map Drop Chance mods increases to mathematically alarming numbers. At 80%, the mechanism is dominated by the random chance portion, but everything still ends up working properly. Above 95% or so, the shield is doing so much on its own that <em>Golden Voids stop being relevant</em>. If your shield has that much VMDC, stop buying Golden Voids, and instead invest those goldens elsewhere. They will have more effect there. ...They will have <strong>any</strong> effect there.</p>
			<h1 id="other-sources">Other Sources of Void Maps (with Obfuscated Spoilers)</h1>
				<p>Throughout the game, there are multiple ways of getting more Void Maps, through both deterministic means and through means which depend on the randomness inherent in the basic void map dropping mechanism. The following list has most of the spoilers scrubbed off, but proceed with caution unless you are okay with hintings of spoilers.</p>
				<div id="listblock">
					<ul>
					<li>An early source gives deterministically more void maps for every void map earned from <em>any</em> source, capping out at 10% more voids overall.</li>
					<li>One source eventually gives a flat total of 20 additional void maps for free every portal.</li>
					<li>A certain pair of unlocks give a variable number of free immediate void maps on portal based on the zone you portalled from.</li>
					<li>Yet another source adds a mechanism by which guaranteed void maps drop for every so many zones cleared <em>on top of</em> the basic dropping mechanism.</li>
					<li>One source, oddly enough, gives its own 20% VMDC as an <em>additive</em> bonus on the Golden Voids, bringing that up to a possible 92% VMDC.</li>
					<li>Another source can give back 5% of the voids you cleared last portal.</li>
					</ul>
